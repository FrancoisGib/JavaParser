# Java Parser to PlantUML

To generate the diagrams, just use the command : ```./java-parser path-to-directory -a``` </br>
It will generate one big diagram with all the classes but if you want to have several small diagrams, just disable the ***-a*** flag
You must have graphviz on your computer to use the plantUML jar. To install graphviz -> ```sudo apt install graphviz```</br>
